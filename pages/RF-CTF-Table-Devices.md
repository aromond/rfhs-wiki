# RF-CTF-Table-Devices

## INFO

This page is here to give some information on devices that you might see or have been seen on the RFHS CTF table. You can learn a lot by looking at what devices are being used to run the challenges, looking at manuals, datasheets, and FCC ID's may all yield useful information that give a better understanding for how you might attack a challenge.

Please keep adding to this as you see fit!

### LRS
Long Range Systems manufacture several versions of pagers and paging devices. At the table you may notice something similar to the on in this image:

Each pager is similar to what you would find at a restaurant. Check the scoreboard for what challenges are live, but if you see this you might need to receive and or transmit packets to and from these devices. LRS usually involves a restaurant id, and a pager id. These numbers are useful and you should figure out how to find them and use them
